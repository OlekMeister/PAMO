 * You have a program that counts pizza slices until there’s a whole pizza with 8 slices. Refactor this program in two ways:
 * Use a while loop.
 * Use a do-while loop.
 * fun main() {
 * var pizzaSlices = 0
 * // Start refactoring here
 * pizzaSlices++
 * println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 * pizzaSlices++
 * println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 * pizzaSlices++
 * println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 * pizzaSlices++
 * println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 * pizzaSlices++
 * println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 * pizzaSlices++
 * println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 * pizzaSlices++
 * println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 * pizzaSlices++
 * // End refactoring here
 * println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
 * }
